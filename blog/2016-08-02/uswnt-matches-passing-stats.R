#You can either start from the very beginning and start with the Excel match 
#spreadsheet.. or skip ahead to just sourcing the csv file that is created
#anyways by tidying the Excel file.

##TIDY THE EXCEL FILE---------
#Download the Excel file for the match you want from this folder in the WoSo Stats GitHub repo: httpshttps://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/tree/master/source/excel
#Make sure the Excel file is in your working directory
#Running the following runs the Excel file through the tidy-excel.R code
#This code cleans up the match spreadsheet (it always looks ugly) and turns
#it into something that can be read by the code below that generates the
#location-based passing stats
#Assign the file name of the Excel file you want to tidy to "match.file"
if (exists("match.file")) {
  source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amj2012/wosostats/master/code/version-2/tidy-excel.R")
}

##OR JUST SOURCE THE CSV FILE----------
#Get the URL for the raw csv file for the match you want from this folder:https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/tree/master/source/csv
#Once you find your match, click on "Raw" to get the URL
#
#Running the following just sources the match spreadsheet in csv format directly
#from the GitHub repo
#Assign the URL of the csv file as "matchURL"
if (exists("matchURL")) {
