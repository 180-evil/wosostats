# 1. Get stats for one match ########
# • Getting stats from each match csv sheet can take approximately 3 seconds, for now
# • You can get stats for one match with the getStatsForMatch function based on the following arguments:
#   1. "match_up"   - the matchup and date in "TEAM1-TEAM2_M/D/YY" format. Must include underscore between team acronyms and date. Date
#                     must be exactly as it is in the data column in the database. So, no leading zeroes, and in month/day/year format.
#   2. "match_csv"  - or, if you've got the match csv sheet in your working environment, assign this value to it.
#   3. "filename"   - or, the location of the match csv sheet in your computer
#   4. "matchURL"   - or, the URL link for the match csv sheet in the WoSo Stats GitHub repo, found under in the match.csv.link column in the database
#   5. "location"   - this is optional. if you want your stats broken down by location on the field, and if so by what location. 
#                     default is "none". other options are by "thirds" or by "zone".
#   6. "per_90"     - logical. this is optional and set to FALSE by default. set this as TRUE if you want "per 90" stats added
#                     to your stats table.
#   7. "database"   - this is optional. most of the time, leave this alone, unless you know what you're doing
#                     and have a database spreadsheet different from what's in the WoSo Stats GitHub repo
# • Run this, with the above arguments filled in:
#                   your_stats <- getStatsForMatch(matchup=NA, match_csv=NA, filename=NA, matchURL=NA, location="none", per90=FALSE, database=NA)
#
# 2. Get match stats for multiple matches  ########
# • Requires an internet connection
# • Select your matches with the getStatsInBulk function based on the following arguments:
#   1. "competition.slug"   - this is mandatory. the string for the competition exactly as it appears in the competition.slug column in the database.
#                             If you're feeling brave (and want to see how long it takes), you can just create stats for the entire database by assigning
#                             this value to "database." You'll be sitting there for several minutes, at least.
#   2. "type"               - this is mandatory. set as "stats.csv.link" to get a list of stats tables for each match, or set as
#                             "match.csv.link" to get a list of match actions for each match.
#   3. "team"               - optional. the string for the team you're looking for, exactly as it appears in the database.
#   4. "round"              - optional. the string for the "round" of the competition (AKA "week"), exactly as it appears in the database
#   5. "multi_round"        - optional. a vector in c("Week X", "Week Y", "Week Z", "etc.") format with multiple "rounds" of a 
#                             competition, again exactly as they appear in the database.
#   6. "month_year"         - optional. the string for the month and year of the competition in "M_YYYY" format (no leading zeroes for month).
#   7. "location_complete"  - optional. assign this to TRUE if you only want to calculate stats for matches with complete location data (will have 
#                             "yes" in the location.data column in the database)
#   8. "per_90"             - optional. assign this to TRUE if you want to add "per 90" stats to your stats table 
#   9. "database"           - this is optional. most of the time, leave this alone, unless you know what you're doing
#                             and have a database spreadsheet different from what's in the WoSo Stats GitHub repo
# • Run this, with the above arguments filled in:
#                     your_stats_list <- getStatsInBulk(competition.slug, team=NA, round=NA, multi_round=NA, month_year=NA, location="none", location_complete = FALSE, per_90=FALSE)
# • Then, you can write those stats csv files in bulk into whatever your working directory is in by running the following:
#   for (index in 1:length(stats_list)) {
#     file_name <- strsplit(matches_names[index], "/")[[1]][[length(strsplit(matches_names[index], "/")[[1]])]]
#     write.csv(stats_list[[index]], file=file_name, row.names = FALSE)
#   }
#
# 3. Calculate stats for multiple matches. ########
# • Use the getStatsInBulk function above, with the type argument set as "match_csv.link", to get a list of stats tables
#   for the set of matches you want (i.e. only Portland matches, only matches from first 10 weeks, etc.)
# • Combine those stats into one table with the mergeStatsList function based on the following arguments:
#   1. "stats_list"   - this is mandatory. assign this to the name of the stat list you created with the getStatsInBulk function. In
#                       the sample code above, we named it your_stats_list.
#   2. "add_per90"    - optional. set as TRUE if you want to add "per 90" stats to the table. Will do this automatically if there are
#                       already "per 90" columns in the stats tables in the stats_list list.
#   3. "location"     - optional, but MUST be set as the same as what was used in getStatsInBulk. Set this as "thirds" if the stats
#                       tables in the stats list are broken down by thirds of the field, and set as "zones" if they are broken down 
#                       by zones of the field. If you didn't do anything with "location" in getStatsInBulk, then you can leave this blank.
# • Run this, with the above arguments filled in:
#                     your_stats <- mergeStatsList(stats_list = your_stats_list, add_per90 = FALSE, location = "none")
