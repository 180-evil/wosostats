# getting stats from each match csv sheet can take approximately 3 seconds, for now

# Get stats for one match
# • You can get stats for one match given one of the following
#   1. "match_up" - the matchup and date in "TEAM1-TEAM2_M/D/YY" format. Must include underscore between team acronyms and date. Date
#       must be exactly as it is in the data column in the database. So, no leading zeroes, and in month/day/year format.
#   2. "match_csv" - if you've got the match csv sheet in your working environment, assign this value to it.
#   3. "filename" - the location of the match csv sheet in your computer
#   4. "matchURL" - the URL link for the match csv sheet in the WoSo Stats GitHub repo, found under in the match.csv.link column in the database
# • For now (as of Feb 10) theres just one "type" of stats. Working on a "location data" so you only get location stats when you need them
#
# match_stats <- getStatsForMatch(matchURL=NA, filename=NA, match_csv=NA, matchup=NA, type="basic", database=NA)

# Get stats for multiple matches! Requires internet connection.
# • Select your matches based on the following.
#   1. "competition.slug" - this is mandatory. the string for the competition exactly as it appears in the competition.slug column in the database.
#       If you're feeling brave (and want to see how long it takes), you can just create stats for the entire database by assigning
#       this value to "database." You'll be sitting there for several minutes.
#   2. "team" - optional. the string for the team you're looking for, exactly as it appears in the database.
#   3. "round"- optional. the string for the "round" of the competition (AKA "week") exactly as it appears in the database
#   4. "multi_round" - optional. a vector in c("Week X", "Week Y", "Week Z", "etc.") format with multiple "rounds" of a 
#       competition, again exactly as it appears in the database.
#   5. "month_year" - optional. the string for the month and year of the competition in "M_YYYY" format (no leading zeroes for month).
#   6. "location_complete" - assign this to TRUE if you only want matches with complete location data (will have 
#       "yes" in the location.data column in the database)
# getStatsInBulk(competition.slug, team=NA, round=NA, multi_round=NA, month_year=NA, location_complete = FALSE)
