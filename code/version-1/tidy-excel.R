## Functions for reading and tidying up a raw Excel file of match stats
## and turning it into a data.frame in your environment

## Install if necessary
require(xlsx)

## IMPORTANT: "matchlocation" must be set as a string value, or this won't work
##
## Might take a while to create. Takes about two minutes. Hold tight.
d <- read.xlsx(matchlocation, sheetName = "match")

## Delete all rows before kickoff, but be sure to save them in a separate data frame for reference
### Gets the row number where the match starts, store in x
x <- grep("kickoff", d[,"poss.player.event"])
### Create data frame of all columns from row 1 to row x, for reference
ref <- d[1:(x-1),]
### Now, delete everything before kickoff from the d data.frame
df <- d[x:nrow(d),]
## Fill in any blanks in 
df$homecount <- as.integer(as.character(df[,"homecount"]))
df$awaycount <- as.integer(as.character(df[,"awaycount"]))
df$home.score <- as.integer(as.character(df[,"home.score"]))
df$away.score <- as.integer(as.character(df[,"away.score"]))
df$event <- as.integer(as.character(df[,"event"]))

## Get rid of all those "-"'s and turn them into blank spaces NA
df[(df) == "-"] <- NA

## Fill in any rows with a "poss.player" value that don't have a "poss.team" value
## Do the same for any rows with a "def.player" value that don't have a "def.team" value
## First, create a vector for the "home" team and the "away" team
teams <- as.character(unique(ref$poss.team))
hometeam <- teams[1]
awayteam <- teams[2]
## Then create a vector for each team's list of players
homeplayers <- as.character(ref[ref[,"poss.team"] == hometeam,"poss.player"])
awayplayers <- as.character(ref[ref[,"poss.team"] == awayteam,"poss.player"])
## Now use these vectors & values to check the "poss.player" columns in df
## that have blank values in "poss.team" and fill in the appropriate value
df[grepl(paste(paste0("^", homeplayers, "$"), collapse ="|"), df[,"poss.player"]), "poss.team"] <- hometeam 
df[grepl(paste(paste0("^", awayplayers, "$"), collapse ="|"), df[,"poss.player"]), "poss.team"] <- awayteam
df[grepl(paste(paste0("^", homeplayers, "$"), collapse ="|"), df[,"def.player"]), "def.team"] <- hometeam 
df[grepl(paste(paste0("^", awayplayers, "$"), collapse ="|"), df[,"def.player"]), "def.team"] <- awayteam

## Get rid of instances where "poss.player" is an NA but has a "poss.team" value.
df[is.na(df[,"poss.player"]),"poss.team"] <- NA
df[is.na(df[,"poss.team"]),"poss.player"] <- NA
