##0. REFERENCE DATA TO SOURCE----------
### ref.classes will be a data.frame of class data for columns in the spreadsheet.
### Sourcing this data.frame and creating the col_types vector below will be
### necessary due to how read_excel() requires the column class types to be in a
### vector for every column in the spreadsheet in the precise order in which they appear.
ref.classes <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amj2012/wosostats/master/resources/spreadsheet-classes.csv")
ref.classes <- read.csv(textConnection(ref.classes), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#needs to return a col_types character that has ALL column classes for EXACTLY 
#every column in the excel spreadsheet

while (x <= length(working.names)){
  #checks if the column name at working.names[x] is a column name with a preassigned class type

    #if TRUE, then gets the column's preassigned class type, and assigns that as an element in col_type
    if(ref.classes[ref.classes[,"col.name"]==working.names[x],"col.class"] == "numeric" | 
       ref.classes[ref.classes[,"col.name"]==working.names[x],"col.class"] == "integer") {

### rosters is a data.frame of player data. For now this is just 2016 NWSL player
### data. This is to account for multiple teams with players with the same last name,
### among other pesky scenarios
rosters <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amj2012/wosostats/master/rosters/nwsl-2016.csv")
rosters <- read.csv(textConnection(rosters), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
##1. READING THE EXCEL FILE----------
## "match" must be a string value and the Excel file must be in the working directory
df <- read_excel(match, col_types = col_types)
df <- as.data.frame(df)

##2. CHANGE COLUMN CLASSES----------
### Changes class of select columns if necessary
### Since this code moved on to using the readxl package instead of the
### xlsx package, changing the column classes isn't necessary.

##3. CLEAN UP----------
### Gets rid of NA columns
df <- df[,!grepl("^NA",names(df))]
### Gets rid of any blank rows after the match has ended (indicated by an end.of.match value)
df <- df[1:max(grep("end.of.match", df[,"poss.action"])),]
### Fills in missing time data. This assumes that, if there are blanks, the first row where 
### a minute appears is the first event for that minute.
x <- grep("kickoff", df[,"poss.action"])
#### in case there's more than one "kickoff" (incorrectly) logged, set x as the first kickoff
if(length(x) > 1) (x <- x[1])
while (x <= nrow(df)) {
  #checks if time is blank
  if (df[x,"time"] == "-" | is.na(df[x,"time"])) {
    #if time is blank, set it as the previous value
    df[x,"time"] <- df[x-1, "time"]
  }
  x <- x + 1
}
### Re-calculates event values, and convert all blanks & "-"s to NA values
#### Assigns all "-"'s and blanks as NA values
x <- 1
while (x <= nrow(df)) {
  if (df[x,"event"] == "-" | is.na(df[x,"event"]) | df[x,"event"] == " ") {
    df[x,"event"] <- NA
  }
  x <- x + 1
}
#### Sets x as row below kickoff
x <- grep("kickoff", df[,"poss.action"])
if(length(x) > 1) (x <- x[1])
x <- x + 1
#### Checks if "poss.player" is NA, "-", or " " and sets appropriate event value
while (x <= nrow(df)) {
  if(df[x,"poss.player"] == "-" | is.na(df[x,"poss.player"]) | df[x,"poss.player"] == " "){
    #sets event value as previous row's event value
    df[x,"event"] <- df[x-1,"event"]
  } else {
    #sets event value as 1 plus previous row's event value
    df[x,"event"] <- df[x-1,"event"]+1
  }
  x <- x + 1
}
#LAST LEFT OFF HERE (7/6 9:23PM)--------
###Gets rid of player numbers and leading/trailing whitespace in "poss.player" and "def.player" values
x <- 1
while (x <= nrow(df)) {
  poss.string <- df[x,"poss.player"]
  def.string <- df[x,"def.player"]
  df[x,"poss.player"] <- trimws(strsplit(as.character(poss.string)," \\(")[[1]][1])
  df[x,"def.player"] <- trimws(strsplit(as.character(def.string)," \\(")[[1]][1])
  x <- x + 1
}

###Creates missing columns
####For spreadsheets that don't yet have "poss.number" or "def.number" columns
if(!("poss.number" %in% colnames(df))) (df$poss.number <- NA)
if(!("def.number" %in% colnames(df))) (df$def.number <- NA)

##METADATA----------
### Creates a meta data frame of all columns from row 1 to row before kickoff
ref <- df[1:(grep("kickoff", df[,"poss.action"])[1]-1),]
### Creates a vector for the "home" team and the "away" team, excluding possible NA values
teams <- as.character(unique(ref$poss.team))
teams <- teams[!is.na(teams) & !(teams=="-") & !(teams==" ") & !(teams=="")]
hometeam <- teams[1]
awayteam <- teams[2]
### home team should always be listed first
homedata <- ref[ref[,"poss.team"]==hometeam,c("poss.position","poss.team","poss.number", "poss.player")]
awaydata <- ref[ref[,"poss.team"]==awayteam,c("poss.position","poss.team","poss.number" ,"poss.player")]
## Create data frame with opposites of each location
posslocations <- c("A6", "A18", "A3L", "A3C", "A3R", "AM3L", "AM3C", 
                   "AM3R", "DM3L", "DM3C", "DM3R", "D3L", "D3C", "D3R", 
                   "D18", "D6", "AL", "AC", "AR", "AML", "AMC", 
                   "AMR", "DML", "DMC", "DMR", "DL", "DC", "DR")
deflocations <- c("D6", "D18", "D3R", "D3C", "D3L", "DM3R", "DM3C",
                  "DM3L", "AM3R", "AM3C", "AM3L", "A3R", "A3C", "A3L", 
                  "A18", "A6", "DR", "DC", "DL", "DMR", "DMC",
                  "DML", "AMR", "AMC", "AML", "AR", "AC", "AL")
opposites <- data.frame(posslocations, deflocations)

##CHECK FOR INCORRECT DATA--------
###Checks if a player's name has certain letters in upper case (this messes with how stats are computed)
x <- grep("kickoff", df[,"poss.action"])
if(length(x) > 1) (x <- x[1])
x <- x + 1
####creates vector of players, excluding blanks
players <- as.character(unique(ref$poss.player))
players <- players[!is.na(players) & !(players=="-") & !(players==" ") & !(players=="")]
while (x <= nrow(df)) {
  #checks poss.player
  if(!is.na(df[x,"poss.player"])){
    y <- 1
    while (y <= length(players)) {
      if (((tolower(df[x,"poss.player"])==tolower(players[y]))) & (df[x,"poss.player"] != players[y])) {
        df[x,"poss.player"] <- players[y]
      }
      y <- y + 1
    }
  }
  #checks def.player
  if(!is.na(df[x,"def.player"])){
    z <- 1
    while (z <= length(players)) {
      if (((tolower(df[x,"def.player"])==tolower(players[z]))) & (df[x,"def.player"] != players[z])) {
        df[x,"def.player"] <- players[z]
      }
      z <- z + 1
    }
  }
  x <- x + 1
}

##CALCULATE MISSING PLAYER DATA---------
### Deletes metadata from df & converts "-", " ", and blank values to NAs
df <- df[grep("kickoff", df[,"poss.action"])[1]:nrow(df),]
df[(df) == "-"] <- NA
df[(df) == " "] <- NA
df[(df) == ""] <- NA
###Goes down df and pairs each number-name combination with the appropriate team value
x <- 1
while (x <= nrow(df)) {
  poss.string <- paste(unlist(df[x,c("poss.number","poss.player")],recursive=TRUE), sep="", collapse=" ")
  def.string <- paste(unlist(df[x,c("def.number","def.player")],recursive=TRUE), sep="", collapse=" ")
  y <- 1
  while (y <= nrow(ref)) {

    }
