## Functions for reading and tidying up a raw Excel file of match stats
## and turning it into a data.frame in your environment
##
## Save the file into your working directory by running read.csv(df, file="filenamegoeshere.csv", row.names=FALSE)
##READING EXCEL FILE----------
## Install if necessary
require(xlsx)
## IMPORTANT: "match" must be set as a string value, or this won't work
## Might take a while to create. Takes about two minutes. Hold tight.
## The Excel file must be in the working directory
df <- read.xlsx(match, sheetName = "match")

##FINDS METADATA----------
## Delete all rows before kickoff and saves them in a separate data frame "head"
### Gets the row number where the match starts, stores it in x
start <- grep("kickoff", df[,"poss.action"])
### Creates a data frame of all columns from row 1 to row x, for reference
ref <- df[1:(start-1),]
### Then, deletes everything before kickoff from the df data.frame
df <- df[start:nrow(df),]
### Changes select column factors to integers
df$event <- as.integer(as.character(df[,"event"]))
### Changes select column factors to characters
df$poss.action <- as.character(df[,"poss.action"])
df$play.type <- as.character(df[,"play.type"])
df$def.action <- as.character(df[,"def.action"])
df$poss.player.disciplinary <- as.character(df[,"poss.player.disciplinary"])
df$poss.notes <- as.character(df[,"poss.notes"])
df$def.player.disciplinary <- as.character(df[,"def.player.disciplinary"])
### Gets rid of all those "-" and "" and turn them into NAs
df[(df) == "-"] <- NA
df[(df) == ""] <- NA
rm(start)
## There are a lot of blank spaces where the team acronym should be. The code below fills them in
### Creates a vector for the "home" team and the "away" team
teams <- as.character(unique(ref$poss.team))
hometeam <- teams[1]
awayteam <- teams[2]
### Creates two different vectors from each team's list of players
homeplayers <- as.character(ref[ref[,"poss.team"] == hometeam,"poss.player"])
awayplayers <- as.character(ref[ref[,"poss.team"] == awayteam,"poss.player"])
### Uses the above vectors & values to check df rows where "poss.team" and "def.team"
### is blank, and fills in the appropriate value based on what the player name is in 
### "poss.player" or "def.player"
df[grepl(paste(paste0("^", homeplayers, "$"), collapse ="|"), df[,"poss.player"]), "poss.team"] <- hometeam 
df[grepl(paste(paste0("^", awayplayers, "$"), collapse ="|"), df[,"poss.player"]), "poss.team"] <- awayteam

df[grepl(paste(paste0("^", awayplayers, "$"), collapse ="|"), df[,"def.player"]), "def.team"] <- awayteam
rm(ref)
## Create data frame with opposites of each location
