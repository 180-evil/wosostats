##Offline Mode
### Trying to do work on a plane & don't want to pay $8 for Wi-Fi? Stuck in a train tunnel?
### Assign "offline" to  online_mode and, assuming you've got the GitHub repo duplicated in
### your working directory, you can just read the files instead of going online.
### Otherwise, if online_mode hasn't been created yet, "online" is assigned to online_mode
if(!exists("online_mode")){

df <- df[1:max(grep("end.of.match", df[,"poss.action"])),]

## ADD COMMON MISSING COLUMNS----------
### Creates missing columns that usually aren't included as they weren't

### is in that row is part of the same event as the row above it (assuming it's all
### been logged correctly).

## CLEAN UP PLAYER NUMBERS AND NAMES----------
### Gets rid of player numbers and leading/trailing whitespace

## CREATE METADATA OBJECTS----------
