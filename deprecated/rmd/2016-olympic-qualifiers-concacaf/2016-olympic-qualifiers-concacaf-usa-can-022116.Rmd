A big thank you to Kombayn for helping log the stats for half of this match.

Attacking Stats
---

* Shots
* Assists & Key Passes
* Big Chances
    * *One-on-one chances that should result in goals*
* Shots Under Pressure
* Shot Location
* Crosses
* Through Balls

### Shots
```{r shots, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
## Creates table for players pased on types of shots.
t <- createTable(c("shots", "accuracy", "shots.scored", "shots.stopped.by.gk", "shots.stopped.by.def", "shots.missed") ,"poss.action", d)

## Add column adding all shot attempts
t$shots <- t$shots.scored + t$shots.stopped.by.gk + t$shots.stopped.by.def + t$shots.missed

## Add column for accuracy
t$accuracy <- (t$shots.scored + t$shots.stopped.by.gk + t$shots.stopped.by.def)/(t$shots.scored + t$shots.stopped.by.gk + t$shots.stopped.by.def + t$shots.missed)

##Sort by "shots" and "accuracy"
t <- t[order(-t$shots, -t$accuracy),]

## Change names to be more readable
names(t) <- c("Shots","Accuracy","Scored","GK Stop", "DEF Stop", "Missed")
print(t, digits=2)

```

### Assists & Key Passes
*A key pass is defined as a pass that leads to a clear goal-scoring opportunity (such as a big chance, defined below). Not all key passes result in goals or even shots, but they're worth noting when they happen*
```{r key_passes, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
t <- createTable(c("key.passes","assists", "second.assists", "unscored.key.passes"), "poss.notes", d)

## Add column for all key passes
t$key.passes <- t$assists + t$second.assists + t$unscored.key.passes

##Sort by "assists" and "second.assists"
t <- t[order(-t$assists, -t$second.assists),]

## Change names to be more readable
names(t) <- c("Total Key Passes","Assists","Second Assists", "Unscored Key Passes")

print(t, digits=2)

```

###Big Chances
*A big chance is a clear goal-scoring opportunity, usually a one-one scenario with the goalkeeper or an unpressured point-blank shot, where the player is expected to score*
```{r big_chances, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
t <- createTable(c("big.chances", "big.chances.scored", "big.chances.shot.on.goal", "big.chances.missed",  "big.chances.dispossessed"),"poss.notes", d)

t$big.chances <- t$big.chances.scored + t$big.chances.dispossessed + t$big.chances.shot.on.goal + t$big.chances.missed

## Sort by "big.chances" and "big.chances.scored"
t <- t[order(-t$big.chances, -t$big.chances.scored),]

names(t) <- c("Big Chances","Scored", "SOG", "Missed", "Dispossessed")

print(t, digits=2)

```

### Shots Under Pressure
*I define what makes a shot (and a pass, for that matter) as being "under pressure" [here.](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/blob/master/resources/definitions.md#defensive-player-actions)*
```{r shots_under_pressure, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
t <- createCleanDataFrame(c("shots", "accuracy", "shots.scored", "shots.stopped.by.gk", "shots.stopped.by.def", "shots.missed") ,"poss.action", d)
## Adds column for whether shot is "pressured" or "challenged"
t <- addColumnForQualifier("pressured", "pressured", "def.action", d, t)
t <- addColumnForQualifier("challenged", "challenged", "def.action", d, t)
t$pressed <- NA
x <- 1
while(x <= nrow(t)) {
  if (t[x,"pressured"] == "yes" | t[x,"challenged"] == "yes") {
    t[x,"pressed"] <- "yes"
    x <- x + 1
  } else {
    t[x,"pressed"] <- "no"
    x <- x + 1
  }
}

## Create table with a column for shots under and not under pressure
t2 <- createTable(c("total", "pct", "yes", "no"), "pressed", t)
## Add "total" and "pct" values
t2$total <- t2$yes + t2$no
t2$pct <- t2$yes/t2$total
# rename and print
t2 <- t2[,2:4]
t2 <- t2[order(-t2$yes),]
names(t2) <- c("Pct of Shots", "Pressured", "Not Pressured")
print(t2, digits=2)

```

### Shot Location
*I split up the field into attacking, middle, and defensive thirds and into left, center, and right sides of the fields. I also noted if a play occurred in the 18 or 6 yard box. If it gets kinda hard to read, just remember that "A"" means the opponent's third of the field, "M" refers to the middle third, "D" refers to the defensive third. The letters R, C, and L refer to right, center, and left sides of the field, respectively.*
```{r shot_location, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
t <- createCleanDataFrame(c("shots", "accuracy", "shots.scored", "shots.stopped.by.gk", "shots.stopped.by.def", "shots.missed") ,"poss.action", d)

## Creates table for shot.location
t2 <- createTable(c("A6", "A18", "A3L", "A3C", "A3R", "Beyond","AM3L", "AM3C", 
                   "AM3R", "DM3L", "DM3C", "DM3R", "D3L", "D3C", "D3R", 
                   "D18", "D6"), "poss.location", t)
## Add everything beyond the attacking 3rd and put it in the "Beyond" column
t2$beyond <- rowSums(t2[,7:17])
## Get rid of all columns after the "Beyond" column to save space
t2 <- t2[,1:6]
print(t2, digits=2)

```

### Crosses
*Crosses are defined as passes, usually through the air, deep into the box from the right or left side of the field. "Corner" refers to crosses from the opposing third of the field and "Long" refers to crosses from deeper up the field.*
```{r crosses, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
t <- createCleanDataFrame(c("corner.crosses", "deep.crosses"), "play.type", d)

## Create table with columns for completed, blocked, and missed crosses
t2 <- createTable(c("completed", "pct", "attempts", "passes.f.c", "passes.f", 
                    "passes.s.c", "passes.s"), "poss.action", t)
## Calculate empty columns
t2$completed <- t2$passes.f.c + t2$passes.s.c
t2$attempts <- rowSums(t2[,4:7])
t2$pct <- t2$completed/t2$attempts
t2 <- t2[,1:3]

## Create table with columns for corner and deep crosses
t3 <- createTable(c("corner.crosses", "deep.crosses"), "play.type", t)

# Merge the two sets of columns
t4 <- cbind(t2, t3)
t4 <- t4[order(-t4$completed, -t4$pct, t4$attempts),]

names(t4) <- c("Completed", "Pct", "Attempts", "Corner", "Long")

print(t4, digits=2)

```

### Through Balls
*Through balls are defined as passes that split the defense and are intended to meet a teammate, running past a defender, at the end of her run*
```{r through_balls, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
t <- createCleanDataFrame(c("through"), "play.type", d)

## Create table
t2 <- createTable(c("completed", "pct", "attempts", "passes.f.c", "passes.f"), "poss.action", t)
## Calculate empty columns
t2$completed <- t2$passes.f.c
t2$attempts <- rowSums(t2[,4:5])
t2$pct <- t2$completed/t2$attempts
t2 <- t2[,1:3]
t2 <- t2[order(-t2$completed, -t2$pct, t2$attempts),]

names(t2) <- c("Completed", "Pct", "Attempts")

print(t2, digits=2)

```

Passing
---

* Overall Passing
* Passing Under Pressure
* Passes by Length

### Overall Passing
```{r overall_passing, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
t <- createCleanDataFrame(c("passes.f.c", "passes.f", 
                    "passes.s.c", "passes.s", "passes.b.c", "passes.b"), "poss.action", d)
t <- addColumnForQualifier("pressured", "pressured", "def.action", d, t)
t <- addColumnForQualifier("challenged", "challenged", "def.action", d, t)
t$pressed <- NA
x <- 1
while(x <= nrow(t)) {
  if (t[x,"pressured"] == "yes" | t[x,"challenged"] == "yes") {
    t[x,"pressed"] <- "yes"
    x <- x + 1
  } else {
    t[x,"pressed"] <- "no"
    x <- x + 1
  }
}


t2 <- createTable(c("completed", "pct", "attempts" , "passes.f.c", "passes.f", 
                    "passes.s.c", "passes.s", "passes.b.c", 
                    "passes.b"), "poss.action", t)
## Calculate blank columns & then get rid of excess
t2$attempts <- rowSums(t2[,c(4:9)])
t2$completed <- rowSums(t2[,c(4,6,8)])
t2$pct <- t2$completed/t2$attempts
t2 <- t2[,1:3]

# Order
t2 <- t2[order(-t2$pct, -t2$completed),]
names(t2) <- c("Completed", "Comp Pct", "Attempts")

print(t2, digits=2)

```

### Passing Under Pressure
*"Pct.of.Passes" refers to the percentage of all pass attempts by a player that were under pressure. I define what makes a pass "under pressure" [here.](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/blob/master/resources/definitions.md)*
```{r passing_under_pressire, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
## Include only passing attempts under pressure
t2 <- t[t[,"pressed"] == "yes",]
## Create table
t2 <- createTable(c("Completed", "Comp Pct","Attempts", "passes.f.c", "passes.f", 
                    "passes.s.c", "passes.s", "passes.b.c", 
                    "passes.b"), "poss.action", t2)
## Fill in blank columns and sort
t2[,"Completed"] <- rowSums(t2[,c("passes.f.c","passes.s.c","passes.b.c")])
t2[,"Attempts"] <- rowSums(t2[,4:9])
t2[,"Comp.Pct"] <- t2[,"Completed"]/t2[,"Attempts"]
t2 <- t2[,1:3]

## Create a table comparing how many passes were under pressure
t3 <- createTable(c("Pct of Passes", "yes", "no"), "pressed", t)
## Add "total" and "pct" values
t3[,"Pct.of.Passes"] <- t3$yes/(t3$yes + t3$no)
## Exclude rows with 0% passes under pressure
t3 <- t3[t3[,"Pct.of.Passes"] != 0,]

## Merge columns
t4 <- cbind(t2,t3)
t4 <- t4[order(-t4[,"Comp.Pct"],-t4[,"Completed"],  -t4[,"Pct.of.Passes"]),]
t4 <- t4[,c("Pct.of.Passes", "Completed", "Comp.Pct","Attempts")]

print(t4, digits=2)

```

Possession
---
* Take Ons
* Aerial Duels

### Take Ons
*A take on is an attempt by a player to get past her defender and maintain possession of the ball. A take on is “won” if the player dribbles past a defender, turns a defender to create open space, or draws a foul. A take on is “lost” if the ball is tackled away, regardless of who recovers the ball or where it ends up, or if the player loses possession through a lost touch or a ball shield.*
```{r take_ons, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
t <- createCleanDataFrame(c("take.on.won", "take.on.lost", "dispossessed", "lost.touch"),"poss.action", d)

t2 <- createTable(c("take.on.won", "Take On Success" ,"Take Ons", "take.on.lost", "dispossessed", "lost.touch"), "poss.action", t)
## Fill in blank columns & rename
t2[,"Take.Ons"] <- t2[,"take.on.won"] + t2[,"take.on.lost"]
t2[,"Take.On.Success"] <- t2[,"take.on.won"]/t2[,"Take.Ons"]
t2 <- t2[order(-t2[,"take.on.won"], -t2[,"Take.On.Success"]),]
names(t2) <- c("Won", "Pct", "Attempts", "Lost", "Dispossessed", "Lost Touches")

print(t2, digits=2)
```

### Aerial Duels
*Aerial duels are when two players challenge for a 50/50 ball in the air. The first player to make contact with the ball is deemed to have won the aerial duel, regardless of where the ball ends up or who recovers it.*
```{r aerial_duels, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
t <- createDataFrame(c("aerial.won", "aerial.lost"), "poss.action", d)

t2 <- t[,c("event", "time", "poss.position", "poss.team", "poss.player", "poss.action", "poss.location")]
names(t2) <- c("event", "time", "position", "team", "poss.player", "player.event", "location")
t3 <- t[,c("event", "time","def.position", "def.team", "def.player", "def.action", "def.location")]
names(t3) <- c("event", "time", "position", "team", "poss.player", "player.event", "location")
t4 <- rbind(t2,t3)

t5 <- createTable(c("aerial.won", "Success Pct", "Aerial Duels", "aerial.lost"), "player.event", t4)

## Fill in blank columns, sort, & rename
t5[,"Aerial.Duels"] <- t5[,"aerial.won"] + t5[,"aerial.lost"]
t5[,"Success.Pct"] <- t5[,"aerial.won"]/t5[,"Aerial.Duels"]
t5 <- t5[order(-t5[,"aerial.won"], -t5[,"Success.Pct"], t5[,"Aerial.Duels"]),]
t5 <- t5[,1:3]
names(t5) <- c("Won", "Pct", "Attempts")

print(t5, digits=2)

```

Defending
