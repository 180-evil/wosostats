So you want to log stats for matches on your own? You’re amazing! Here are the steps you to take:

#Before you start logging the match stats
1. Download the match-stats-templae.xlsx Excel document from this link: https://github.com/amj2012/woso-stats/blob/master/resources/match-stats-template.xlsx?raw=true.  
  * Using Excel is highly recommended as the ability to format, auto-fill, auto-complete, and utilize formulas makes the job of logging stats way easier and faster.
  * To get an idea of what this spreadsheet should look like, it can help to refer to the sample spreadsheet, based on a match between USA and Trinidad & Tobago, which can be found here: https://github.com/amj2012/woso-stats/blob/master/resources/match-stats-sample.xlsx?raw=true. 
2. In the `poss.player` column, write in the last name of each player who played in the match as either a starter or a sub, starting with all the home team players. Do the same for the `def.player` column.
3. In the `poss.team` and `def.team` columns, write in the acronym of the team for each respective player. 
  * For club teams, refer to the acronyms.csv spreadsheet which can be found at: https://github.com/amj2012/woso-stats/blob/master/resources/acronyms.csv.
  * For international teams, refer to the FIFA country codes
4. In the `poss.position` and `def.position` columns, write in the starting position for each respective player.
Don’t get too fancy. Just write in one of “GK,” “D,” “M,” or “F.”
5. Field dimensions can vary widely, so figure out where the borders of the middle third are, so you can tell if a player is in their attacking, middle, or defensive third.
  * It helps to use landmarks around the stadium to figure this out. For example, if the field has football lines or lawn stripes, you can use them to figure out the thirds of the field.
  * Or, you can also use the stands as landmarks.
  * Worst comes to worst, find the widest shot you can of the field, either during the match stream or from an image online, and literally use a ruler to figure out the thirds of the fields.
6. Try to also get a sense of where the left, center, and right thirds of the fields are. The left and right thirds will usually cut a few yards into the 18-yard box, and the center third will usually extend a few yards from the center circle. Width of the field can vary widely, so use your best judgment here.
7. The template spreadsheet should be 1500 rows long. However, if the match you are logging requires more rows and ends up going into blank rows (beyond the ones filled in with “-” hyphens), then guesstimate how many more rows you’ll need and fill them all in with additional “-” hyphens (more on what those are about below).

#While logging match stats
1. Start logging stats in the row below the one with “kickoff” in the `poss.action` column.
2. Create a new row for the following types of events (refer to the events-definitions.doc file for how to define each event), to be typed in the “poss.action” exactly as it’s shown in italics for each event
  * Shots stopped by the goalkeeper - `shots.stopped.by.gk`
  * Shots stopped by a defender - `shots.stopped.by.def`
  * Shots blocked by a defender - `shots.blocked`
  * Shots missed - `shots.missed`
  * Shots scored - `shots.scored`
  * Forward pass attempts - `passes.f`
  * Sideway pass attempts - `passes.s`
  * Backward pass attempts - `passes.b`
  * Movement into another zone - `movement`
  * Take ons won - `take.on.won`
  * Take ons lost - `take.on.lost`
  * Dispossessed of the ball - `dispossessed`
  * Aerial duels won - `aerial.won`
  * Aerial duels lost - `aerial.lost`
  * Recoveries - `recoveries`
  * Balls shielded - `ball.shield`
  * Clearances - `clearances`
  * Offside Calls - `offside.calls`
  * Substitutions - `substitution.on` & `substitution.off`
There will be instances where play is either stopped or peskily cut off by the broadcast. There will also be breaks in play. These instances should be noted.
  * Play cut off by broadcast - `playcutoffbybroadcast`
  * Halftime - `halftime`
  * Fulltime, but with extra time on the way - `fulltime`
  * End of first period of extra time - `end.of.1.ET`
  * End of second period of extra time - `end.of.2.ET`
  * End of the match - `end.of.match`
  * Other stoppages in play - `stoppage.in.play`
3. For every single new action logged in the “poss.action” column, the value in that row’s “event” column should automatically increase by 1. 
If the “poss.action” column has a “-” denoting that there are additional defensive actions being credited to the event, then the value in the “event” column should remain the same. The idea is that a new event is only triggered by a new possessive action or something like a stoppage in play or break in broadcast.
For every single new action logged in the “poss.action” column, log the possessing player’s name in “poss.player” and the location of the event in “poss.location.”
In the “poss.location” column, you must type in the appropriate acronym, in italics below. The location is relative to the player for which you are logging it (e.g. a player is in her 18-yard box if she is defending someone in possession of the ball in the opponent’s 18-yard box, and vice versa)
(A6) - Opponent’s 6-yard box
(A18) - Opponent’s 18-yard box 
(A3L) - Attacking third, left wing 
(A3C) - Attacking third, center field 
(A3R) - Attacking third, right wing 
(AM3L) - Opponent’s half of middle third, left wing 
(AM3C) - Opponent’s half of middle third, center field 
(AM3R) - Opponent’s half of middle third, right wing 
(DM3L) - Own half of middle third, left wing 
(DM3C) - Own half of middle third, center field 
(DM3R) - Own half of middle third, right wing 
(D3L) - Defensive third, left wing
(D3C) - Defensive third, center field 
(D3R) - Defensive third, right wing 
(D18) - Own 18-yard box 
(D6) - Own 6-yard box 
The “poss.play.destination” column should only be filled in if the following event was cut off by a broadcast interruption or a stoppage in play. For example, if a player completes a pass, but the receiving player did not have a chance to create an event worth logging because the broadcast decided to interrupt the feed with a replay, then manually enter the destination of the action. Otherwise, there is no way of determining the destination.
The “play.type” column should be filled in for the following types of passing and shots actions written in italics below.
(corner.crosses) - Crosses from the corner area 
(deep.crosses) - Crosses from beyond the 18-yd box 
(switch) - Switch; A long, high ball to an intended recipient across the field
(launch) - Launch balls; Long, high balls into open space or into a crowded area 
Launch balls from the wings into the box should be logged as corner.crosses or deep.crosses.
(through) - Through balls ; A pass splitting the defense, into open space, to meet a teammate at the end of her run 
(lay.off) - Lay-offs ; A one-touch backwards pass
(flick.on) - Flick-ons ; A glancing pass into the same general direction from which it came from
(throw.in) - Throw ins 
(free.kick) - Free kicks , regardless of whether it ends up being a pass or shot
(headed) - Headed passes or shots
(corner.kick) - Corner kicks
(goal.kick) - Goal kicks 
(gk.throws) - Goalkeeper throws 
(gk.drop.kick) - Goalkeeper drop kicks 
(header.shot) - Headed shots 
(pk) - Penalty kicks 
For each event in the “poss.action” column, log any of the following defensive actions in italics below in the “def.action” column. Refer to the action-definitions.doc file at ___ for in-depth definitions for each action
(dispossess.ball.shield) - Dispossessing a player by stepping between the player and the ball and ultimately shielding the ball 
(dispossess.steal) - Dispossessing a player by stealing the ball 
(dispossess.lost.touch) -Dispossessing a player by winning a lost touch 
(tackles.ball.away) - Tackling the ball away for another player to recover 
(tackles.ball.won) - Tackling and winning the ball 
(dribbled.tackles.missed) - Being dribbled due to a missed tackle 
(dribbled.out.run) - Being dribbled due to being out-run, also known as getting “burnt” 
(dribbled.turned) - Being dribbled due to being turned

(aerial.lost) - Losing an aerial duel 

Goalkeepers have their own types of defensive actions in the “def.event” column”
(gk.s.o.g.stop) - Shots on goal stopped by the goalie
(gk.s.o.g.def.stop) - Shot that would have been scored but was stopped by the last defender
(gk.s.o.g.scored) - Goals conceded 
(gk.shot.miss) - Shots missed faced
(gk.high.balls.won, gk.high.balls.lost) - High balls won or lost 
(gk.smothers.won, gk.smothers.lost) - Smothers won or lost 
(gk.loose.balls.won, gk.loose.balls.lost) - Loose balls won or lost 

Create a new row if necessary when there are multiple defensive actions for one possessing event, but be sure to leave the “poss.action” column blank so that a new event number is not accidentally created
For each “def.action” value, fill in the corresponding player in the “def.player” column.
The “def.location” column should ONLY be filled in for certain defensive events, which are to be written in as they written in italics below:
Blocks (blocks)
Interceptions (interceptions)
Balls shielded (balls.shielded)
Clearances (clearances)
All goalkeeper-specific events
For all goalkeeper defensive actions, except for missed shots and goals, you should further describe the action by filling in the “gk.ball.stop” column with the appropriate descriptor for what happened to the ball, to be written as it is shown in italics below:
Caught (caught)
Punched to safety (punched.to.safety)
Punched to danger (punched.to.danger)
Mishandled or dropped the ball (dropped)
Missed the ball (missed.the.ball)
Collected the ball from the ground (collected)
Parried to safety (parried.to.safety)
Parried to danger (parried.to.danger)
For goalkeeper defensive actions that are shots on goals, log the type of save attempt, regardless of whether it was successful, by filling in the “gk.s.o.g.attempt” column with one of the following values to be written as it is shown in italics below:
(diving) - Goalkeeper dived to the ground or into the air for the ball
(standing) - Goalkeeper remained standing with the ball going directly at her
(reaching) - Goalkeeper reached for the ball with her hands or feet
(stooping) - Goalkeeper reached down for the ball, usually collapsing onto it 
(none) - Goalkeeper did not attempt to save the ball
If a foul was committed, log for the possessing player in the “poss.player.disciplinary” column and for the defending player in the “def.player.disciplinary” column one of the following values to be written as it is shown in italics below:
Fouls won (fouls.won)
Fouls conceded (fouls.conceded)
Yellow cards (yellow.cards)
Red Cards (red.cards)
Penalties won (penalties.won)
Penalties conceded (penalties.conceded)
Certain possessing player actions need additional qualifiers, related to scoring opportunities or defensive mistakes, that should be added in the “poss.notes” column, to be written in as they are shown in italics below. In the event that more than one of these apply to the same event, add them all into the same cell but separate them by a comma:
(big.chances.scored) - Big chances scored
(big.chances.shot.on.goal) - Big chances not scored but shot on goal 
(big.chances.dispossessed) - Big chances lost from a dispossession or bad touch 
(big.chances.shot.missed) - Big chances shot and missed
(assists) - Assists
(second.assists) - Second assists 
(unscored.key.passes) - Unscored key passes 
(out.of.bounds.keep.poss) - Ball goes out of bounds, but still in possession of the possessing team
(out.of.bounds.lost.poss) - Ball goes out of bounds and possessing team loses possession 
(errors.to.goals) - Errors leading to goals
(errors.to.big.chances) - Errors leading to unscored big chances
 Similarly, certain defending player actions need additional qualifiers, related to defensive accomplishments and mistakes, that should be added in the “def.notes” column, to be written in as they are shown in italics below.
(big.chances.stopped) - Big chances stopped 
(own.goals) - Own goals 
(errors.to.goals) - Errors leading to goals 
(errors.to.big.chances) - Errors leading to unscored big chances 
When a new minute in play is reached, change the “time” column for the first event of each minute to the time in minutes. An event in the first 30 seconds is in minute 1, an event at 30:34 is in minute 31, and so on. 
For stoppage time, use a plus sign to denote how much stoppage time was added. For example, 2 minutes into stoppage time after 90 minutes should be written as “90+3”, NOT as “93.” The same goes with examples such as “45+3”, “120+1”, and so on.

#After logging match stats
Delete all unused rows with “-” hyphens below the row with the end.of.match action
Quickly browse and search through the spreadsheet and be on the lookout for anything that doesn’t look right.
Search and replace every “-” hyphen with a blank “” value (do not replace it with a space “ “ value).
If this affects any hyphenated player names, search through the name that was changed and replace it with the correct name that was affected.
Save the file as an .xlsx file. There are other types of Excel files, but DO NOT save them as those types, just as an .xlsx file.

#What’s next
Save the Excel file in the wo-so Github repository by doing one of the following:
IF you are comfortable with using GitHub, push the Excel file as an addition to the wo-so repository.
OR if you are not comfortable with using GitHub or if your have no idea what that the above paragraph was about, just email me the raw Excel file at alfredom790@gmail.com.
Turn the Excel file into the filled-in completed .csv file that will be used for the actual analyses, by doing one of the following:
IF you are comfortable with using R:
set the directory in which the Excel file is as the working directory
source the tidy-excel.R file in ______. This should create a data frame named df in your working environment.
save the df data frame as a .csv file in either your working directory or anywhere else you’d like
If you’re comfortable with GitHub, push the new .csv file as an addition to the appropriate folder in the wo-so depository. Otherwise, just email me the .csv file at alfredom790@gmail.com.
IF you are not comfortable with using R to create this .csv file yourself, just notify me via email and I’ll take care of it.
You’re done! Please do celebrate, as this is great data that can be analyzed and it surely takes a lot of work for each match.
See the match analysis for yourself by downloading the template.Rmd R Markdown file, and in the first chunk change matchlocationgoeshere to the file location of either the csv file in your computer (if you made the csv file yourself) or the raw URL of the csv file’s location in the GitHub repository. OR, I’ll just email you the match analysis myself as soon as I create it.
