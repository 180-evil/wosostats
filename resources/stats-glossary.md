*This is a glossary for stats shown in [the WoSo Stats Shiny app](https://amj2012.shinyapps.io/wosostats/) and in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/tree/master/analysis/csv). It is a work in progress and will change over time as more stats are added.*

*The definitions are in the order in which they appear in the stats table.*
