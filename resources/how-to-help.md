If you'd like to contribute to our growing knowledge base about women's soccer stats, there are two ways you can direcly help:

1. **Log match actions**
2. **Add location data to logged matches**

Logging match actions involves picking a match for which you have a replay or download, downloading [the Excel template](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/blob/master/resources/match-stats-template.xlsx), and adding event info as you watch the match according to the [instructions in the how-to-log-stats.md document](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/blob/master/resources/how-to-log-stats.md). Logging an entire match takes a total of about 6 hours, but it is not recommended that you work on any more than one half of a match, as anything more is an exceedingly tremendous amount of work.

I will typically ask you to log the first 15 minutes of a match, just to see how you do and send you feedback before you're ready to log the entire half.

To add location data to matches that are already logged, because location data is not initially logged so as to save time and get basic stats logged first, [read throughouly how to log stats](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/blob/master/resources/how-to-log-stats.md), with a focus on the sections about location data, and send me a DM on Twitter at @WoSoStats or email me at alfredom790@gmail with what teams you'd like to help with. I am working on creating a database of matches that are missing location data, but
