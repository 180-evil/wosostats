# woso-stats
This repository is for a collection of stats from women's soccer matches

The [analysis](https://github.com/amj2012/woso-stats/tree/master/analysis) folder is where to find the documents that show the results of each match analysis. Working on putting these into a blog to make it easier to read. Soon.

The [code](https://github.com/amj2012/woso-stats/tree/master/code) folder is where to find the R code that is used to process and analyze the source Excel and csv files.

The [resources](https://github.com/amj2012/woso-stats/tree/master/resources) folder is where to find necessary and helpful resources for how to log stats on your own (please help! volunteers needed!) and definitions for what is being measured and analyzed.

The [source](https://github.com/amj2012/woso-stats/tree/master/source) folder is where to find the Excel and csv files of stats logged for each match.
